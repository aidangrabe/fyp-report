\section*{Abstract}
Android Wear is a version of the Android operating system, currently tailored
for smartwatches, announced on March 18, 2014. This project explores the
underlying technology powering Android Wear and demonstrates some of it's
capabilities with a smartwatch and mobile application targeting students
and their day-to-day activities.

The project consists of three main components. A research project demonstrating
the low level APIs of Android Wear and displaying the raw data acquired from the
different sensors. The second, is a student application using some of the
sensors and information acquired by the research project and using it in a 
practical way to create a usable application for college students. The third
component is a custom watch face designed specifically for Android Wear that
demonstrates how the Android Wear watch face APIs work.
